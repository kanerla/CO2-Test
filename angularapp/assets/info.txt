Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a colourless, odourless and non-poisonous gas formed by combustion of carbon and in the respiration of living organisms and is considered a greenhouse gas.
CO2 emissions are stemming from the burning of fossil fuels and the manufacture of cement; they include carbon dioxide produced during consumption of solid, liquid, and gas fuels as well as gas flaring.

A CO2 equivalent is a metric measure used to compare the emissions from various greenhouse gases on the basis of their

by converting amounts of other gases to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide with the same global warming potential.

Carbon dioxide plays a key role in plant life and helps keep the earth warm.
Increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, though, are linked to global warming, and could cause all life on Earth to die.
